# Yuma Nur Alfath's Digital Garden  
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته

Hi, Welcome to my [Digital Garden](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy), where I I document my journey, thoughts, and the projects I'm tinkering with. Feel free to take a look and see what I've been up to..

I’m just a curious person who loves learning about how the world works. My background is in chemistry, but my interests often lead me into exploring science, technology, and any new ideas that spark my curiosity. I don’t see myself as an expert — I just enjoy learning, experimenting, and finding connections between different fields.

Got an idea for a subject I should investigate? Reach out thought the social links in the website footer or my [website](https://www.yumana.my.id) .

وَالسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ 🙏
