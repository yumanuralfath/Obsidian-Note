### Skill 2
[[Be careful of object of preposition]]

An object of a [[preposition]] is a [[noun]], pronoun, gerund or noun clause  ***( read this : [[Subject]])*** that comes after a preposition, such as *in, at, of, to, by, behind, on*, and so on, to form a prepositional phrase.

(After his *exams*) Tom will take a trip (by *boat*).

This sentence contains two objects of prepositions. Exams is the object of the preposition after, and boat is the object of the preposition *by*.
An object of a preposition can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because it can be mistaken for the subject of a sentence.

In this example you should look first for the subject and the verb. You should notice the verb found and should also notice that there is no subject. Do not think that friend is the subject; friend is the object of the preposition with, and one noun cannot be both a subject
and an object at the same time. Because a subject is needed in this sentence, answer (B), he, is the best answer. Answers (A), (C), and (D) are not correct because they cannot be subjects

### Skill 3
[[Be Careful of Appositives]] 

![[Pasted image 20251019175219.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251019175255.png]]

In this example you should recognize from the commas that George, is not the subject of the
sentence. George, is an [[Appositive]]. Because this sentence still needs a subject, the best answer is (D), my.friend. Answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they are not subjects.
The next example shows that an appositive does not always come after the subject; an
appositive can also come at the beginning of the sentence.

### Skill 4
[[Be Careful of Present Participle]]

A present participle is the *-ing* form of the verb *(talking, playing)*. In structure questions on the TOEFL test, a present participle can cause confusion because it can be either a part of the verb or an [[Adjective]]. It is part of the verb when it is preceded by some form of the verb *be.*

<div style="text-align: center;">
 The man <u>is talking </u> to his friend<br>
  VERB
</div>

In this sentence *talking* is part of the verb because it is accompanied by *is*.
A present participle is an adjective when it is not accompanied by some form of the verb *be*.

![[Pasted image 20251019194600.png]]

In this sentence *talking* is an adjective and not part of the verb because it is not accompanied by some form of *be*. The verb in this sentence is *has*.
The following example shows how a present participle can be confused with the verb in structure questions on the TOEFL test.

![[Pasted image 20251019194745.png]]

In this example, if you look at only the first words of the sentence, it appears that child is the subject and playing is part of the verb. If you think that playing is part of the verb, you might choose answer (B), is, or answer (D), was, to complete the verb. However, these two answers are incorrect because playing is not part of the verb. You should recognize that playing is a participial adjective rather than a verb because there is another verb in the sentence is. In this sentence there is a complete subject child and a complete verb is, so this sentence does not need another subject or verb. The best answer here is (A).
The following chart outlines what you should remember about present participles:

### Skill 5
[[Be Careful of Past Participles]]

[[Past Participles]] <b>verb III</b> of a verb, such and was) as <b>studied</b>, <b>taught</b>, <b>cooked</b> and many others. Past participles can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because a past participle can be either <b>an adjective</b> or <b>a part of a verb</b>.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. As a part of a verb.</b></div>
Past participle functions as a part of a verb if it is accompanied by have, has, had and to be (am, is, are, were and was). _Example:_
<div style="text-align: center;">The family has <b>purchased</b> a television.</div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; VERB</div>


<div style="text-align: center;">The poem was <b>written</b> by Paul.</div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VERB</div>

1. In the first sentence the past participle **purchased** is **part of the verb** because it is accompanied by has.
2. In the second sentence the past participle **written** is **part of the verb** because it is accompanied by was.

**2. As an [[Adjective]]**
Past participle functions as an adjective if it is not accompanied by have, has, had and to be. Example:

The television **purchased** (Adj) yesterday was expensive.
The poem **written** (Adj) by Paul appeared in the magazine.

- In the first sentence **purchased** is an **adjective** rather than a verb because it is not accompanied by a form of be or have (and there is a verb, was, later in the sentence). 
- In the second sentence **written** is **an adjective** rather than a verb because it is not accompanied by a form of be or have (and there is a verb, appeared, later in the sentence).

### Skill 6
[[Use Coordinate Connectors Correctly]]

When you have two clauses in an English sentences, you must connect the two sentences correctly. One way to connect two clauses is to use [AND, BUT, OR, SO, or YET](https://preparationtoefl.blogspot.com/2011/09/use-coordinate-connector-correctly.html) between the clauses. 

_Look at the following sentences_:
- Tom is singing, **and** Paul is dancing.
- Tom is tall, **but** Paul is short.
- Tom must write the letters, **or** Paul will do it.
- Tom told a joke, **so** Paul laughed
- Tom is tired, **yet** he is not going to sleep.

In each of these sentences, there are two clauses that are correctly joined with a coordinate conjunction **AND, BUT, OR, SO** or **YET**, and a comma (,).

### Skill 7
[[Use Adverb Time and Cause Connectors Correctly ]]

Sentences with adverb clauses have two basic patterns in English. Study the clauses and connector in the following sentences.

_I will sign the check_ before, _you leave_
Before _you leave_, _I will sign the check._

In each of these examples, there are two clauses _you leave_ and _I will sign the check_, and the clause you leave is an adverb time clause because it is introduced with the connector before. 

In the first example, the connector before comes in the middle of the sentence, and no comma (,) is used.

In the second example, the connector before comes at the beginning of the sentence. In this pattern, when the connector comes at the beginning of the sentences, a comma (,) is required in the middle of the sentence.

![[Pasted image 20251020195909.png]]

### Skill 8
[[Use Other Adverb Connectors Correctly]]
Adverb Clauses can express the ideas of time and cause, as you read in skill 7. Adverb clause can also express a number of other ideas, such as contrast, condition, manner and place. Because these clauses are adverb clauses, they have the same structure as the time and cause clauses in Skill 7. Study the following sentences.

I _will leave_ at 7:00 if _I_ _am_ ready
Although _I_ _was_ late, I _managed_ to catch the train

In each of theses examples, there are two clauses that are correctly joined with adverb connectors.  In the first sentence, the adverb condition connector _if_ comes in the middle of these sentences. In the second sentence, the adverb contrast connector _although_ comes at the beginning of the sentence, and a comma (,) is used in the middle of the sentence.

The following example shows a way that this sentence pattern can be tested in the structure section of the TOEFL Test.
_Example:_

_You will get a good grade on the exam provided......................_
_(A) studying_
_(B) study_
_(C) to study_
_(D) you study_

In this example, you should quickly notice the adverb condition connector _provided_. This connector comes in the middle of the sentence; because it is a connector, it must be followed by a subject and a verb.The best answer to this question is answer (D), which contains the subject and verb _you study_.  

The following chart lists adverb contrast, condition, manner and place connector and the sentence patterns used with them.

### Skill 9
[[Use noun clause connector correctly]]

 A noun clause is a clause that functions as a noun. Because the noun clause is a noun, it is used in a sentence as either an object of a verb; an object of preposition, or the subject of the sentence.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLbNb7jim9T2NSKYqYZhcOcDwk_Oy5bs7-I3Mza-zSegub9g6II5I7ODFc-cy1MPaqC6iBn6tNzJEEKCC3qrGGBXQVn2m-LKPpzUR9280P4OG9NK21UPSeK5zG0mn3oOWAVMK8rVHT31k/s1600/9a.PNG)

In the example above, there two clauses, _**I know**_ and _**he will come**_. This clause is joined by a connector _**WHEN**_. WHEN changes the clause _**he will arrive**_ into a noun clause that functions as the object of the verb _**KNOW.**_

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjt5jC8ZbvyUvCaDPscDnDOy7vPzhfJf-Bkf8u8LFJfWIw6VEe-UvBicMFFVMuSALm9vZ4yfuQcY4mGstwXV8q_uoydqwdYWdlYSnWUyqc40uCUFp1VZXhYTrH2hh3TetSUe9HNSfaXFf4/s1600/9b.PNG)

In the example above, there two clauses, _**I am concerned**_ and _**he will arrive**_. This clause is joined by a connector _**WHEN**_. _**WHEN**_ changes the clause _**he will arrive**_ into a noun clause that functions as the object of the preposition _**ABOUT.**_

  

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9FIqdfogHmD8muRjKd-kkOCXB_UmOTwVK8CwC246GO8UeIU9lKu2D__0qLjvBFSl90v9rAkspSWxrExRyl_6Ecsk7WdQTZj0BHr0bNjo7DaBwMOLEGiCWuxhpP0W2v0UIZ7sXDAVsuhg/s1600/9c.PNG)

  
In the example above, It is more difficult. There are two clauses, but they area a little harder to recognize. _**He will arrive**_ is is one of the clauses, and the connector _**WHEN**_ changes into a noun clause that functions as the subjects of the sentence. The other clause has the main clause _**WHEN HE WILL ARRIVE**_ as its _**subject**_ and is as its v_**erb**_.  
  
_**Example:**_  
  
___________ was late caused many problems  
  
A. That he  
B. The driver  
C. There  
D. Because  
  
Answer (A)  
  
In this example, there are two verbs (was and caused) and each verb needs SUBJECT. The best answer is (A). That is the SUBJECT of CAUSED and HE is SUBJECT of WAS.  
  
So, the complete sentence is THAT HE WAS LATE CAUSED MANY PROBLEMS

### Skill 10 
[[Use Noun Clause Connector or Subject Correctly]]

In skill 9, [[Noun Clause]] connectors were used to introduce noun subject clauses or noun object clauses.

In this 10, a noun clause connector is not only a connector; a noun clause connector cam also be the subject of the clause at the same time.


![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEhDCd48YIG-OId74kTV5-qJwrApYKx8T0gCS-9tEI5mhhh8-IbeamHYoSXckoC43pMAvgzumO2C4S__a7u6yfhaEuIPTG3cyHmYaHCgkOlolcpmuQdk0FRQUuQGG-PClfZ3QlluMZ4wU/s1600/10.JPG)

  
In the first example, there two clauses; _**I do not know**_ and **_what is in the box_**. These two sentences are connected by the connector _**what**_.  
  

In the second example, there two clauses, in the first clause _**we**_ is the subject of _**are**_. In the second clause _**who**_ is the subject of _**will.**_ _**Who**_ also serves as _**the connector**_ that join the two clauses.The noun clause _**who will do the work**_ function as the object of preposition _**about**_.  
  
In the last example,there are two clauses, _**whoever**_ is the subject of  the verb _**is coming**_ and the noun clause **_whoever is coming to the party_** is the subject of _**must bring**_. The word _**whoever**_ serves two function in the sentences; the subject of the verb _**is coming**_ and the connector that joins the two clauses.  
  
_**Example**_:  
  
__________ was on television made me angry.  
  
A. It  
B. The story  
C. What  
D. When  
  
In the example above, there two VERBS, _**was**_ and _**made**_. Each of those verbs needs a _**Subject**_ . Best Answer is _**C (What)**_. _**What**_ is the subject of verb _**was**_ and the verb _**made**_. What also serves as the connector that connect the two clauses together.
