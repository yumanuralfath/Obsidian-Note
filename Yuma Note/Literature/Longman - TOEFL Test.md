### Skill 2
[[Be careful of object of preposition]]

An object of a [[preposition]] is a [[noun]], pronoun, gerund or noun clause  ***( read this : [[Subject]])*** that comes after a preposition, such as *in, at, of, to, by, behind, on*, and so on, to form a prepositional phrase.

(After his *exams*) Tom will take a trip (by *boat*).

This sentence contains two objects of prepositions. Exams is the object of the preposition after, and boat is the object of the preposition *by*.
An object of a preposition can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because it can be mistaken for the subject of a sentence.

In this example you should look first for the subject and the verb. You should notice the verb found and should also notice that there is no subject. Do not think that friend is the subject; friend is the object of the preposition with, and one noun cannot be both a subject
and an object at the same time. Because a subject is needed in this sentence, answer (B), he, is the best answer. Answers (A), (C), and (D) are not correct because they cannot be subjects
