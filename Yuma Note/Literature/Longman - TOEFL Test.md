### Skill 2
[[Be careful of object of preposition]]

An object of a [[preposition]] is a [[noun]], pronoun, gerund or noun clause  ***( read this : [[Subject]])*** that comes after a preposition, such as *in, at, of, to, by, behind, on*, and so on, to form a prepositional phrase.

(After his *exams*) Tom will take a trip (by *boat*).

This sentence contains two objects of prepositions. Exams is the object of the preposition after, and boat is the object of the preposition *by*.
An object of a preposition can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because it can be mistaken for the subject of a sentence.

In this example you should look first for the subject and the verb. You should notice the verb found and should also notice that there is no subject. Do not think that friend is the subject; friend is the object of the preposition with, and one noun cannot be both a subject
and an object at the same time. Because a subject is needed in this sentence, answer (B), he, is the best answer. Answers (A), (C), and (D) are not correct because they cannot be subjects

### Skill 3
[[Be Careful of Appositives]]

![[Pasted image 20251019175255.png]]

In this example you should recognize from the commas that George, is not the subject of the
sentence. George, is an [[Appositive]]. Because this sentence still needs a subject, the best answer is (D), my.friend. Answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they are not subjects.
The next example shows that an appositive does not always come after the subject; an
appositive can also come at the beginning of the sentence.

### Skill 4
[[Be Careful of Present Participle]]

A present participle is the *-ing* form of the verb *(talking, playing)*. In structure questions on the TOEFL test, a present participle can cause confusion because it can be either a part of the verb or an [[Adjective]]. It is part of the verb when it is preceded by some form of the verb *be.*

<div style="text-align: center;">
 The man <u>is talking </u> to his friend<br>
  VERB
</div>

In this sentence *talking* is part of the verb because it is accompanied by *is*.
A present participle is an adjective when it is not accompanied by some form of the verb *be*.

![[Pasted image 20251019194600.png]]

In this sentence *talking* is an adjective and not part of the verb because it is not accompanied by some form of *be*. The verb in this sentence is *has*.
The following example shows how a present participle can be confused with the verb in structure questions on the TOEFL test.

![[Pasted image 20251019194745.png]]

In this example, if you look at only the first words of the sentence, it appears that child is the subject and playing is part of the verb. If you think that playing is part of the verb, you might choose answer (B), is, or answer (D), was, to complete the verb. However, these two answers are incorrect because playing is not part of the verb. You should recognize that playing is a participial adjective rather than a verb because there is another verb in the sentence is. In this sentence there is a complete subject child and a complete verb is, so this sentence does not need another subject or verb. The best answer here is (A).
The following chart outlines what you should remember about present participles:

### Skill 5
[[Be Careful of Past Participles]]

[[Past Participles]] <b>verb III</b> of a verb, such and was) as <b>studied</b>, <b>taught</b>, <b>cooked</b> and many others. Past participles can cause confusion in structure questions on the TOEFL test because a past participle can be either <b>an adjective</b> or <b>a part of a verb</b>.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. As a part of a verb.</b></div>
Past participle functions as a part of a verb if it is accompanied by have, has, had and to be (am, is, are, were and was). _Example:_
<div style="text-align: center;">The family has <b>purchased</b> a television.</div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; VERB</div>


<div style="text-align: center;">The poem was <b>written</b> by Paul.</div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VERB</div>

1. In the first sentence the past participle **purchased** is **part of the verb** because it is accompanied by has.
2. In the second sentence the past participle **written** is **part of the verb** because it is accompanied by was.

**2. As an [[Adjective]]**
Past participle functions as an adjective if it is not accompanied by have, has, had and to be. Example:

The television **purchased** (Adj) yesterday was expensive.
The poem **written** (Adj) by Paul appeared in the magazine.

- In the first sentence **purchased** is an **adjective** rather than a verb because it is not accompanied by a form of be or have (and there is a verb, was, later in the sentence). 
- In the second sentence **written** is **an adjective** rather than a verb because it is not accompanied by a form of be or have (and there is a verb, appeared, later in the sentence).

### Skill 6
[[Use Coordinate Connectors Correctly]]

When you have two clauses in an English sentences, you must connect the two sentences correctly. One way to connect two clauses is to use [AND, BUT, OR, SO, or YET](https://preparationtoefl.blogspot.com/2011/09/use-coordinate-connector-correctly.html) between the clauses. 

_Look at the following sentences_:
- Tom is singing, **and** Paul is dancing.
- Tom is tall, **but** Paul is short.
- Tom must write the letters, **or** Paul will do it.
- Tom told a joke, **so** Paul laughed
- Tom is tired, **yet** he is not going to sleep.

In each of these sentences, there are two clauses that are correctly joined with a coordinate conjunction **AND, BUT, OR, SO** or **YET**, and a comma (,).
